## Progress report week 3

### What I have done this week?
  - Improved main classes
  - Bugfix to paranthesis parser, couldn't parse complex propositions correctly
  - Added features for proposition that have negations
  - Improved code quality with pylint
  - Created Breadth-First Search algorithm to help printing the binary tree
  - Fixing conjunction connective symbol issue
  - Didn't have time to get software running at Fly.io

### How the software has progressed 
  - All features related to conjunction and disjunction rules pretty much done
  - Features for negations started
  - Prints propositions clauses at correct height in UI

### Problems
  - No new major problems, pretty clear plan what to do next
  - Getting software into production failed -> fly launch failed.

### Questions
  - No questions

### Next week
  - Manage to run software with more complex propositions that have multiple negation symbols
  - Add features for propositions that have implication and equivalence symbols
  - Continue writing docstrings for more complex functions
  - Improve semantic tree result in UI
