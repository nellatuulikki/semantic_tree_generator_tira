The purpose of the project is to create an algorithm to solve and print semantic tree of any propositional clause in Python. 
In logic, semantic trees are used to generate all valuations that are true.

# Algorithm and data structures used
The semantic trees are 

## Input and output format
The user will give an input string which is combined of propositional symbols, connectives and brackets for identification of subformulas.

## Output
The output is
