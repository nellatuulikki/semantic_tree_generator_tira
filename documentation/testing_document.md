## Performance testing

Software has been tested with proposition clauses that has conjunction and disjunction as connectives. Also, some proposition clauses with negations have been tested. 
(a∨b)∧(b∨c)
¬(a∧b)∨(b∧c)

Nested negation clauses doesn't work yet (e.g. ¬(¬(a∧b)∧c)). Also, the software doesn't have proper proposition validator, so possibility for ending up with error is really high. The performance is tested with result generated by BFS algorithm. All tested propositions are generating sub-propositions at correct hight in the printed binary tree.
