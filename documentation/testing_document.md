# Testing document

## Unit testing
Unit testing is done with pytest. Testing result is little bit lower than last week.

## Code Quality
Code quality has been checked with pylint. There is still room for improvement on code quality.

## Performance testing

The list of proposition clauses that works correctly
a↔b
¬a↔b
(a→b)→(b→c)
(a∧b)∨(b∧c)
¬(¬a∨b)
(a∧b∨d)∨(b∧c)
¬(¬(¬a))
¬(a→b)→(b→c)
(a∧b∨d)∨(b∧c)∨(b∧a)

The list of proposition clauses that works incorrectly
¬a↔¬b (doesn't generate children for ¬¬b)
¬(¬(a↔b)∨(a↔b)) (doesn't generate children for a↔b)

Nested negation clauses doesn't work yet (e.g. ¬(¬(a∧b)∧c)). Also, the software doesn't have proper proposition validator yet, so possibility for ending up with error is really high. The performance is tested with result generated by BFS algorithm. All tested propositions are generating sub-propositions at correct height in the printed binary tree.
