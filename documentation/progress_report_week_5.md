## Progress report week 4

### What I have done this week?
  - Improved main classes.
  - Added features for proposition that have double negations, implications and equivalents
  - Improved code quality with pylint
  - Added more test for semantic_tree_node.py
  - Did peer review
  - Didn't have time to get software running at Fly.io
  - Didn't have time to update UI

### How the software has progressed 
  - Features for semantic tree rules pretty much done. Left is to check if the path from the root to a leaf has a negation of proposition symbol as well as the proposition symbol.

### Problems
  - No new major problems, pretty clear plan what to do next
  - Getting software into production failed -> fly launch failed.

### Questions
  - No questions

### Next week
  - Test more complex propositions
  - Get complex equivalent propositions working
  - Starting refactoring
  - Improve semantic tree result in UI
  - Add more tests

### Hours used
