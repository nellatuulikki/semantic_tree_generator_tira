## Progress report week 1

### What I have done this week?
  - I've created a project repository in Github and structure for materials.
  - Testing that repository is working as it should be.
  - I also tried to recap things from Data Strustures and Algorithms course, since it has been a year I completed the courses
  - Basically most of my time I spent on googling about the subject itself, and if there are any known algorithm thay would help implementing the branching rules.

### How the software has progressed 
  - The software itself hasn't been started yet

### Problems
  - It was difficult to say exact data structures the project uses in this state. 
  - This led that it was difficult to comment about time complexity, because I'm not sure if the data structures I'm planning to use are ideal for the project.

### Questions
  - Nice to have a comments about data structures I'm planning to use.

### Next week
  - Creating proposition validator
  - Starting to implement binary tree structure in Python and testing it with some simple propositional clauses
  - Simple UI

### Hours used
  -  5
